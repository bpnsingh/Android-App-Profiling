Android App Performance Logger

This is a Python script that logs the CPU usage, memory usage, and battery percentage of an Android app using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). The script runs on a computer connected to an Android device over USB, and periodically retrieves the app's performance metrics using ADB commands.

The performance metrics are logged to a CSV file, which can be used for further analysis or visualization. The script is intended for developers and testers who want to monitor the performance of their Android apps during development or testing.

Usage instructions:

1. Connect an Android device to your computer over USB, and enable USB debugging on the device.

2. Install the ADB command-line tool on your computer if it's not already installed.

3. Modify the script variables at the top of the file to specify the package name of the app you want to monitor, the name of the CSV log file, and the logging interval (in seconds).

4. Run the script using Python 3. The script will start logging the app's performance metrics to the CSV file.

#Dependencies: Python 3, ADB command-line tool.

Note: This script is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Please use it responsibly and in accordance with your app's terms of service.
